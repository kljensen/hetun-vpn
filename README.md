  🐡⚡💻<br>Hetun VPN<br>
</h1>

_Easily create a road-warrior VPN based on OpenBSD._ I'd like this to be something like [Algo](https://github.com/trailofbits/algo)
but based on [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/) and the [OpenIKED](http://www.openiked.org/). Code is an [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) role that you can install
with `ansible-galaxy install kljensen.hetun_vpn`.
